# The Dream Machine Website
Will start off its life as a static page serving yt links. Very much a work in progess and more of a learning exercise than anything else.

### Things we need from podcasters

    - Nav (sidebar or just a list of links)
        - Home
        - Merch (not yet)
        - About
        - Contact
- List of podcasts (carousel of eps with a thumbnail)
